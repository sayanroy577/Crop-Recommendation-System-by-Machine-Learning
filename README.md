# Crop-Recommendation-System-by-Machine-Learning

The Jupyter Notebook Crop_Recommendation_System.ipynb implements a machine learning project to recommend optimal crops based on soil and environmental factors such as pH, nitrogen, temperature, and rainfall. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the use of classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests. The model is evaluated using accuracy. This system is aimed at assisting farmers in making informed decisions for better agricultural yield.
